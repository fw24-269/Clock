# React + Vite

Welcome to the Real-Time India Clock project! This React.js application displays the current time in India (IST - Indian Standard Time) with real-time updates. Perfect for anyone needing to keep track of India's time zone, whether for business, travel, or personal use.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
